# Soup-Troop-makes-reproducible-code
Purpose of "Soup-Troop-makes-reproducible-code":

The purpose of this repository is to plot data from LaMont Cole dataset which documents spider, weevil, and 
sowbug density found under forest logs. The code presented in this repository will plot both Cole's data and 
Poisson distributions based on the mean values determined from this data. Each specimen of 
arthropod--spiders, weevils, and sowbugs--is documented on separate graphs with separately fitted Poisson 
and LGP distributions.
